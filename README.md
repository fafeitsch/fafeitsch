# Hello all!

I'm Fabian â€“ a software developer located in Wuerzburg. I do Java, Go, and Typescript, 
and occasionally, other cool stuff.

My repositories mainly consist of small side projects of mine. Most of them are just little experiments,
some other are small and very use-case tailored programs. Feel free to look around, but don't expect too much :).

When I'm not programming, I often juggle, go for a run, play my guitar or just enjoy non-programming time :).
